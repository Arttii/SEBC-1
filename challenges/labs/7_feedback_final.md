## Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
The boot camp was really useful, not difficult but the time is never enough because a bunch of issues may arise at any time. Thankfully, except for the challenges, I've never had issues, but if I had I don't know if the time was enough to complete and understand the labs.

## Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
The topic that was least familiar is security (excpecially sentry) while the most familiar was all the installation part.

## Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
The most useful topic was the security topic since is a topic of which I didn't know anything before the boot camp.

## How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
I guess I'd install a production cluster as soon as I understand what happened to my cluster during the challenges. I need to work on troubleshooting, but I guess it's something that comes with experience.
