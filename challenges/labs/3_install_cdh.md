To Install CDH we just need to access http://54.93.102.220:7180 and follow the wizard.

The following hosts were added to the cluster:
```
ip-10-1-0-4.eu-central-1.compute.internal
ip-10-1-0-7.eu-central-1.compute.internal
ip-10-1-0-9.eu-central-1.compute.internal
ip-10-1-0-10.eu-central-1.compute.internal
ip-10-1-0-12.eu-central-1.compute.internal
```

Only the Core Hadoop roles were installed using the default configuration.
